# Real-time-color-detection-using-OpenCV-and-Python
Welcome to the world of real-time red color detection using OpenCV and Python! This repository contains a Python script that leverages OpenCV to detect red objects in live video streams. The code processes video frames, converts them to the HSV color space for improved color detection, and applies morphological operations to reduce noise. It identifies and draws rectangles around red objects, calculating the average color within each object. The detected color is displayed as an RGB label on the video feed. This project is a hands-on example of computer vision and image processing, showcasing how OpenCV can be used for practical applications. Explore the code and learn about color detection techniques while working with real-time video streams.
